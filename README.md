### Featured Projects

Here are a few highlights of what I've been working on:

* **Real-Time Spotify Analytics Dashboard**
    * A web-based dashboard that connects to the **Spotify API** to provide real-time analytics on currently playing and recently played songs. Built using Express.js and Vanilla JS.
* **Pokémon Generation Predictor (Machine Learning)**
    * Fine-tuned a machine learning model (e.g., using **PyTorch** and **Pandas** for data prep) to accurately predict the Pokémon generation (I-III) based on their attributes. Hosted a basic web-application showcasing the model using Flask.
* **Bookshelf Full-Stack Application**
    * *\[In Progress\]* Developing a personal book-logging application. The backend is powered by a **Python (FastAPI)** server for efficient API handling, and the frontend is being built using **TypeScript** for better maintainability and scalability.
* **TCP Chat Client/Server**
    * *\[In Progress\]* Building a command-line chat application to deepen my understanding of network programming. This project uses **C++** to implement fundamental **TCP** socket programming concepts for reliable communication between the client and server.
